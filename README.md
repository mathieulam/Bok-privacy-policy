# Läsa - Privacy Policy

Updated on: 22.09.2024

Welcome to Läsa, the app designed to help you reach your daily reading goals. Your privacy is important to us, and this Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your personal information within the Läsa app.

### Information Collection and Use

Läsa is designed to store all user data locally on your device. This means that the data you enter into the app is not transmitted to any servers or third parties, except for anonymized usage data collected through TelemetryDeck (explained below). The types of data stored locally include:

- Your daily reading goal: The target amount of minutes you set for reading each day.
- Your streak: The number of consecutive days you have met your daily reading goal.
- Your sessions: Records of each reading session, including the date and duration of time spent reading.

### Purpose of Data Collection

The data collected by Läsa is solely for the purpose of enabling you to track your progress towards your reading goals. It allows you to:

- Monitor and adjust your daily reading goals.
- View your current streak and work to maintain or increase it.
- Review past reading sessions to understand your reading habits and patterns.

In addition, we use TelemetryDeck to collect anonymized usage data. This helps us understand how our users are interacting with the app and how we can improve it. TelemetryDeck does not collect any personally identifiable information. You can read more about TelemetryDeck’s privacy policy at [TelemetryDeck Privacy Policy](https://telemetrydeck.com/privacy/).

### Data Storage and Security

All data collected by Läsa is stored locally on your device. We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information stored within the app. However, as the data is stored locally, the security of this information also depends on the security measures of your device.

### Data Sharing and Disclosure

Since all personal data is stored locally on your device, Läsa does not share or disclose any of your information with third parties. Your data remains private and is accessible only by you, through the app.

The only data transmitted from your device is the anonymized usage data collected by TelemetryDeck, which helps us improve the app. This data is non-personal and cannot be used to identify you.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
