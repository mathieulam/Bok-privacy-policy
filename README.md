Review past reading sessions to understand your reading habits and patterns.
3. Data Storage and Security

All data collected by Bok is stored locally on your device. We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information stored within the app. However, as the data is stored locally, the security of this information also depends on the security measures of your device.
